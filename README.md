# Predicting Kickstarters

In this project we analyzed data on various projects on a famous crowdfunding website, Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a social funding platform that allows creatives and companies from a variety of fields to raise money to realize their visions. The concept uses ‘crowdfunding’ to allow patronage from users of the products itself rather than traditional investors. 
As aspiring entrepreneurs and near-future graduates, we chose this topic as we wanted to know how to launch a startup in various fields and make a successful crowdfunding campaign. We hope to, by ways of inference of the data, understand what affects the chances of success on Kickstarter and how.  
We first train models and try to gain an initial understanding of the predictors and their significance. We then analyze trends among categories over the years, and use these trends to make better predictions and inferences. Finally, we make our conclusions on how to make a successful Kickstarter campaign.
